<h1 id="welcome">Welcome!</h1>

Welcome to the GitHub repo for the National Day of Civic Hacking at the White House! We're excited to be working with you.

Our goal for the hackathon on June 1 is to help participants release full, production-ready apps that leverge the We the People API and make them available under an open source license.

While there's limited space at the event we'll hold at the White House that day, we hope this repo will allow everybody to take part.

We hope that you'll use this repo as a space to coordinate with other participants. If you'd like to form groups to work on a shared project, or to post code here for other participants to reuse, please feel free. This is your sandbox.

To report bugs in the  We the People API, please	visit the [repo for the White House petitions application](https://github.com/WhiteHouse/petitions
).
